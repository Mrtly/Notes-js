###  Notes App with JavaScript
<hr>
 
#### The idea
A frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
As part of this primary goal, a sub-goal should be that we are able to explain and give an example of asynchronous behaviour in Javascript.

##### Specification

a user can:
- [x] see a list of the notes; each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
- [x] see the full text of an individual note on its own page
- [x] create a new note
<br>

* notes are not permanently stored; if the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes

#### Built with

vanilla JavaScript, following TDD

##### Visit

[vanilla-notes.surge.sh](http://vanilla-notes.surge.sh/)

##### View

##### Test

the test results live in the console! <br>
(open devtools, go to console)
