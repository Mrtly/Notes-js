###  Notes App with JavaScript
<hr>
 
#### The idea
A frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
As part of this primary goal, a sub-goal should be that we are able to explain and give an example of asynchronous behaviour in Javascript.

##### Specification

a user can:
- [ ] see a list of the notes; each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
- [ ] create a new note
- [ ] see the full text of an individual note on its own page
<br>

* notes do not need to be permanently stored; if the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes

#### Built with

JavaScript, using TDD

##### Run

`git clone` this repo, and open index.html in a browser

##### Test

open index.html in a browser and open the console, that's where the test results are
